# 🔥 Firefighting Robot Project

This is a collaborative project where we design an autonomous robot that can:
- Detect fire using a camera and computer vision 🔥
- Detect and avoid obstacles (like cups, walls, etc.) 🚧
- Navigate toward the fire source and stop nearby 🚶‍♂️💥

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Real-time fire detection with Roboflow-trained model
- ✅ Obstacle detection using image processing
- 🛠️ Integration with hardware (motors, sensors)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python (OpenCV, Roboflow API)
- Google Colab
- Arduino / Raspberry Pi (optional)
- GitHub for version control
